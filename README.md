The NoHurdle app helps you with Wordle-like problems, where you have to find a given 5-letter word. Type in the word(s) you have input, and set the color the game has shown for each letter, either by tapping repeatedly or long-pressing for a pop-up. Each letter defaults to gray if color is not set.

Press the "find words" button to see candidates given the current clues. You can also click a candidate below to add it to the words above.

The app narrows down the possible words, but it doesn't know the answer for today's problem (that would make the game completely trivial).

This app is a pet project for learning how to code for Android. No guarantees, naturally.
